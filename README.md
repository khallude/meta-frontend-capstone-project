# Zeytuni Restaurant – Frontend Website

## 1. Overview

Zeytuni Restaurant is a responsive frontend website built as the capstone project for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate. The site focuses on delivering a modern restaurant experience with a clean layout, menu presentation, and basic booking/contact flows using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Features

- Landing page with hero section and restaurant branding  
- Sections for menu/highlighted dishes  
- Call‑to‑action buttons (e.g. reserve, order, contact)  
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- Interactive elements implemented with JavaScript (e.g. navigation, forms, or simple UI behaviour depending on your implementation)

(You can add 1–2 bullets here for any specific features you have, like a booking form or testimonials.)

## 3. Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

(If you used anything extra like React, a CSS framework, or a design system from the Meta course, you can add it here.)

## 4. Project Structure (example)

```text
zeytuni-restaurant-project/
│
├── index.html        # Main page
├── /css              # Stylesheets
├── /js               # JavaScript files
└── /assets           # Images, icons, etc.
```

(Adjust names to your actual folders/files.)

## 5. How to Run

1) Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khallude/zeytuni-restaurant-project.git
cd zeytuni-restaurant-project
```

2) Open the project:

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or  
- Use a simple static server (e.g. Live Server extension in VS Code) for better development experience.

## 6. Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add a fully functional reservation form with backend integration  
- Add dynamic menu data (e.g. from JSON or an API)  
- Improve accessibility and ARIA attributes  
- Add light/dark mode or more advanced animations
